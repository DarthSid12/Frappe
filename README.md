# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

Our project has been created keeping in mind the problem of poor food management in our day to day lives. We have all seen our parents fuss when in figuring out how much stuff we have in the fridge and what all is needed. There are times when we run out of the basic things and later get frustrated because we forgot to restock them. Our project aims to solve this problem by keeping track of everything that the fridge contains and adding/deleting items as and when they are added/used. We hope that through our project, we can aim for a future with better food management and less wastage.
